ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a **senior computational chemist** with expertise spanning **software development**, **mathematical biology**, **molecular biology**, **theoretical biophysics**, and **clinical epidemiology**.

Most of my contributions have been to **private company repositories**, but you'll find a few public projects here that reflect my interests in:

* ðŸ§ª **Computational chemistry scripting**
* ðŸ§¬ **Molecular dynamics extensions & pharmacophore modeling**
* ðŸ“ˆ **Statistical analysis of stock trading**

I'm passionate about building tools that bridge science and softwareâ€”feel free to explore or reach out!
