- 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony Nash, a senior computational chemist and software engineer. 
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling protein folding using Molecular Dynamics, particularly metalloproteases, fibril tissues of the human extracellular matrix, and membrane proteins. I am also interested in drug discovery epidemiology of real-world electronic healthcare records.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Multilevel Models.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on transmembrane protein modelling using Molecular Dynamics.
