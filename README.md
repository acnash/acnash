- 👋 I am a senior computational computational biophysicist, software engineer, and clinical epidemiologist.
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling protein folding using Molecular Dynamics, particularly metalloproteases, fibril tissues of the human extracellular matrix, and membrane proteins. I am also interested in the drug discovery epidemiology of real-world electronic healthcare records.
- 🌱 I’m currently implementing Neural Network Potential Molecular Dynamics simulations
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on transmembrane protein modelling using next-generation Molecular Dynamics.
