### 🧬 About Me

I am a polymath scientist and engineer with a PhD in **Mathematical Biology and Biophysical Chemistry** from the **University of Warwick**. My work spans **theoretical biophysics**, **computational chemistry (cheminformatics and quantum chemistry)**, **bioinformatics**, **machine learning**, and **systems design**.

My scientific expertise lies in **molecular modelling of protein dynamics**, particularly the **MMP family** (including **MMP14**, a membrane-anchored metalloprotease). I develop computational methods for **membrane protein systems**, **free-energy landscapes**, and **shape-derived pharmacophore modelling** of drug binding sites.

I have also contributed to **drug discovery pipelines**, integrating **computational chemistry** with **statistical analysis of real-world healthcare data** from UK General Practice and hospital records.

In parallel, I pursue research in **time-series machine learning**, with applications to **financial markets** and predictive analytics.

Currently, I serve as an **independent science consultant** collaborating on a **drug discovery program at Arizona State University**.

Before returning to science full-time, I worked in **software engineering** during the early smartphone era. I believe **system design outweighs syntax**—great architecture is timeless, while code is transient. 

Outside of research, I am an **independent market trader** and an **international Taekwondo instructor** with over **32 years of experience**.

Science, for me, is a vocation, **pursued for understanding, not financial gain**.
