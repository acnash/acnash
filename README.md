- 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony Nash, a senior research scientist at The University of Oxford and Human Centric Drug Discovery, Oxford (UK).
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling protein folding using Molecular Dynamics, in particular metalloproteases, fibril tissues of the human extracellular matrix, and membrane proteins. I am also interested in drug discovery epidemiology of real world electronic healthcare records.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Multilevel Models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on transmembrane protein modelling using Molecular Dynamics.
